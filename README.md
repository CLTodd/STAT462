# STAT462: Applied Regression Analysis
The Pennsylvania State University  
Remote Synchronous  
Spring 2021
  
These is a collection of the weekly/bi-weekly labs I completed for my STAT462 class during my sohphomore year at Penn State. For each lab (except Lab 8) the data and the and a set of analysis questions were given to us. I did not record the lab questions, the files in this repository are just my answers. All of the work was done entirely on my own, none of the labs involved group work. You'll notice each lab is formatted differently, that was mostly me having fun using different RMarkdown templates. I'm still learning the ins and outs, excuse my occasionally poorly formatted YAML headings.

Lab 8 involved picking your own data and conducting whatever type of analysis you wanted. I chose to analyze the effect of different demographic features on the average SAT scores of New York City high schools. I found the data I used with the [NYC Open Data search engine](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). See Lab 8 for more details.
  
This repository was not used to maintain workflow for the majority of my labs, I just uploaded my work here toward the end of the semester. I did use this for work flow for Lab 8.
  
One of the labs has a picture of my cat. We just needed to prove we knew how to embed pictures into our lab reports, that photo can be otherwise ignored. I don't remember which lab, but that's the context if you find it. 
  
This may be updated with more details in the future.  
  
*Currently, Labs 7 and 8 have not been uploaded. Since this is a public repository, I am waiting until after the instructor releases the grades to upload my work.*
