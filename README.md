# STAT462
For my Applied Regression Analysis
  
Many of the comments for my commits are terribly non-descriptive, which is mostly just because this repository contains everything I did for this class, and many repo updates were things that weren't worth typing out. 
Since this repo isn't really a project with specific goals or workflow in mind, I would be constantly writing commit messages like "Lecture 21 materials and notes and sample code and also homework pdfs and updated midterm project" which doesn't seem worth the effort of trying to back up class files.
