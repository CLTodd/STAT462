# STAT462: Applied Regression Analysis
**The Pennsylvania State University**  
Spring 2021 | Remote Synchronous  
  
These is a collection of the weekly/bi-weekly labs I completed for my STAT462 class during my sophomore year at Penn State. For each lab the data and a set of analysis questions were given to us. I did not record the lab questions, the files in this repository are just my answers. All of the work was done entirely on my own, none of the labs involved group work. Higher-numbered labs represent later, more advanced work. All of the report files are named clt5441_labX per course requirement, after my school email <clt5441@psu.edu>. Our labs were done entirely within an RMarkdown file and knitted to an HTML, per course requirement. 

You may notice each lab is formatted differently, that was mostly me having fun using different RMarkdown templates. I'm still learning the ins and outs, excuse my occasionally poorly formatted YAML headers.  

<!--  Lab 8 involved picking your own data and conducting whatever type of analysis you wanted. I chose to analyze the effect of different demographic features on the average SAT scores of New York City high schools. I found the data I used with the [NYC Open Data search engine](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Details to come. Edit: The end of the semester was more hectic than I thought and I ended up opting out of lab 8 and enjoying a restful summer after a year of burnout.

This repository was not used to maintain workflow for the majority of my labs, I just uploaded my work here toward the end of the semester. You may notice commit messages that mention a Lab 8. I ended up opting out of Lab 8 and enjoying a restful summer after feeling a bit burned out, this coincided with the tail end of my prolonged recovery from COVID-19.<!--I did use this for work flow for Lab 8.  -->
  
One of the labs has a picture of my cat. We just needed to prove we knew how to embed pictures into our lab reports, that photo can be otherwise ignored. That's the context if you find it. 
  
This may be updated with more details in the future.
